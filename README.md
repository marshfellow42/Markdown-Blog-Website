# Markdown-Blog-Website
A website for me to share my ideas

The website is entirely made on Markdown using Github Pages ```Jekyll```

Because I don't want to bother learning HTML, CSS and JS for now. But I'll learn it later for a creating my own Static Website without the help of any framework

The ideas is not for me to become a web dev, but simply have a place to share my ideas
