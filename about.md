This is my personal blog website for info dumping all my brain

I've been wanting to do something like for quite some time now

And I'm really happy that a simple solution that uses what I've been using regularly for almost a year at this, is available. Meaning that I don't have to use any bloated solution like Next.JS or Hugo, or something that involves a Javascript framework just to translate Markdown to HTML

I just need to work on the CSS because it still isn't the perfect solution I always wanted, but it's a headstart and a simple solution for what I wanted to do all along
